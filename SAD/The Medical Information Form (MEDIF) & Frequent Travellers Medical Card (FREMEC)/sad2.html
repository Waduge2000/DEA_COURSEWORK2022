<p>
    Frequent Traveller’s Medical Card (FREMEC) - Easing travel formalities for the convenience of our differently abled frequent flyer customers who require special assistance and care.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Passengers holding a FREMEC card are no longer required to submit a MEDA form signed by their physicians each time they fly with us, provided there has been no change in their condition or the assistance required.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Obtaining a FREMEC is as simple as submitting a one-time medical form to any SriLankan Airlines office worldwide. The one time form, downloaded from here and filled and certified by his/her personal physician. On evaluation and eligibility, SriLankan Airlines’ Medical Services would then issue a FREMEC card in the name of the passenger to be collected from the relevant Ticket Office.
