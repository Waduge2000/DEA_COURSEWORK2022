            We’ll try to make your flight as stress free as possible! We’ve got diapers, baby food and bassinets on board. Special diaper changing boards are also located in selected toilets. SriLankan Airlines makes every effort to ensure your children will have a safe and enjoyable flight.

        <h2>
            Is your child travelling alone?
        </h2>

<p>
    For a child travelling alone, a journey by air can be quite intimidating.
</p>

<p>
    We at SriLankan Airlines take extra care when it comes to unaccompanied minors. It is our greatest pleasure to make sure that they are looked after and happy from the moment they arrive in our care until the moment we reunite them with loved ones.
</p>

<p>
    While under our care, we guarantee constant attention to your child. He / she will have plenty of fun on board with our goody bag of games and activities. What’s more, he / she will also have an array of children’s in-flight entertainment, plus tasty food and refreshments to keep them occupied throughout the flight.
</p>

<p>

    Upon arrival, your child will be met immediately by one of our ground staff and will be escorted through immigration, baggage claim and customs and will be reunited with you within the arrivals area.
</p>


<p>
    In order to ensure a hassle-free flight, please make sure that your child has all the legal travel documents including passport, visa, health certificate and other necessary documents required.

    Obtaining bassinet seats
</h2>

<p>
    If you have requested or are planning on requesting a bassinet seat for your infant, here are a few notes that you should take into consideration.
</p>

<p>
    Although bassinets are confirmed at the time of reservation, the decision on providing the bassinet on board shall be made by the operating cabin crew, taking into consideration the laid down safety requirements.
</p>


<p>
    Bassinets are awarded for an infant in the case when the infant in question fulfills the following requirements.
